## About myself ##

I am studying at an online, stage-0, RS-school. Before I completed a layout course in HTML-Academy.  The first education is a teacher of biology and chemistry. There are scientific articles. But what really fascinates me is the world of programming, so I began to study the layout. *English level: A2*.
